# DeepFLEX

## About

DeepFLEX is a semi-automated, deep learning-based pipeline for unsupervised single-cell analysis of MELC (Multi-Epitope Ligand Cartography) imaging data. The pipeline is based on methods for image processing and segmentation, feature extraction, normalization and single-cell analysis that were recently published by our group [1], [2] and other experts in the field [3], [4], [5].

## Data availability

Download the MELC imaging data of our 8 samples [here](https://cloud.stanna.at/sharing/gDdiRiSxs).  
A compiled release with all necessary dependencies pre-installed is available from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/imageprocessing29092020/deepflex).	

## Installation

For interactive and quantitative analysis of single-cell data generated by DeepFLEX, we used:  
- Cytosplore: an interactive tool for single-cell analysis (download [here](https://www.cytosplore.org/))
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): a python data visualization library
