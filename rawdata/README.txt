Patient sample MELC images have to be stored here before building the docker container.
Otherwise a folder with the patient sample MELC images has to be linked into the docker to /workspace/data.

Folder structure:
BM1_1 # Patient 1, sample 1
-- 1_FoV
-- 2_FoV
-- 3_FoV
-- 4_FoV
BM1_2 # Patient 1, sample 2
-- 1_FoV
-- 2_FoV
-- 3_FoV
-- 4_FoV
...
